Fun experiments on Octave/MATLAB

#About Octave

Octave is an open-source and free alternative to MATLAB.
It is basically a Scientific Programming Language which I love to use.

#Downloading Octave

To download Octave, simply visit https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/#install
Don't worry if you have Windows. Most of my Octave scripts were written using
some Octave version for Windows 10, so you should be fine.

#Running the files
 
After you are done, navigate to my ".m" files from your Octave GUI or CLI
and run the appropriate ".m" file to see the program work.

#Final Note

Have fun running those scripts and feel free to Fork and/or Branch this or
any of my repos!
